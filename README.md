# react-webpack-typescript-boilerplate

I decided to post my boilerplate code for using React 16.3, Webpack 4, Sass and Typescript.
This is everythig you need to get up and running with typescript, react, sass and webpack.

# to use..

1: Clone Repo,
2: yarn / npm install ( yarn install --latest for those in the future )
3: yarn / npm run dev for development
4: Have fun coding
5: yarn / npm run build to compile and build when ready to deploy

# to do..

configure eslint
